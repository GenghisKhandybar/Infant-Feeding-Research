This is the analysis and code folder for the research project.

To use in Rstudio: 
1. Go to New Project -> Version control -> github, and enter this project's URL.
2. Add all_data.csv and behavior_codebook.csv to the folder generated by the new workspace. (Data is not yet publicly availiable).
3. Run data_reshaping.rmd
4. You should now be able to run/knit any of the analysis files.



Adding new data:

1. Add all new and old raw data files to data-processing.
2. Create a new .rmd file copying whichever existing processing file matches the data format.
3. Add the new file to creating-all-data.
4. Run each data rmd, then run creating-all-data.
5. Replace old all_data in the main folder with the newly created all_data.
6. Run incompatible_check_new in the main folder, make sure it comes up empty (validated).
7. All files should now be able to run successfully.
